Congratulations!  You should now have a working blog application.  But there
are more possibilities.


New features

Our blog is missing a standard set of features that most web applications have.

help with the implementation of the features.

* `Delete a blog entry <https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_blogr/issues/6>`_
* :ref:`Testing <pyramid:testing_chapter>`
* Forgot password, which sends an email to the user to reset their password,
  :ref:`using events <pyramid:events_chapter>`
* `HTTP caching
  <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/introduction.html#http-caching>`_
